The purpose of the system I will be building is to analyze the overall topics people are discussing when tweeting about Bitcoin in the last couple of months.
Users trying to understand people’s views on Bitcoin will benefit from exploring this question.

The dataset is from Kaggle. The features are: User Name, User Location, User Description, User Followers, User Verified, Date Tweet created, the Tweet, Hashtags used, Source of Tweet and whether it was retweeted or not. An individual unit of analysis is a tweet. I don’t believe I have a target for this project. I will be using about 2000 rows of data.

The tools I will be using to form the project are scikit learn and NLTK.

The MVP will be finding a few key topics through Topic Modeling.
